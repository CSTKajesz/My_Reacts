        <p>
            I was looking for a framework to replace CSS3,
            and that's how I came across Tailwind.
            This website came to life because I wanted to practice Tailwind,
            so the whole site was built using React and Tailwind.
            Its subject is about presenting Tailwind, installing, handling styles,
            typography, objects, layout design, animations, and all of this is written in
            Tailwind, focusing on Tailwind's features.
            I equipped the website with a navbar and a sidebar, and it contains numerous subpages.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1em' }}>Some facts from site:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How to install Tailwind</li>
            <li>Typography</li>
            <li>Object Properties</li>
            <li>Object Metrics</li>
            <li>Layout</li>
            <li>Animation</li>
        </ul>
