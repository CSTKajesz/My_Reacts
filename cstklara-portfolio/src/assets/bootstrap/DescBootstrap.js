        <p>
            I had to try out Bootstrap, and this page was the best fit for it. On this website, you can store images. The idea came from the fact that everyone has a lot of collected images, and there is no unified storage solution for them. In the future, I plan these developments.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1em' }}>Future developments:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Connect with an API</li>
            <li>Searchable image names</li>
            <li>Filterable themes</li>
            <li>Database uploading</li>
            <li>Autorization</li>
            <li>Designing an image viewer</li>
        </ul>
    </>
);

export default descBootstrap;
