        <h2>Learning React Router <strong className="coral">Project</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Once again, the website was created for learning purposes.
            When we were learning React Router, I had to test out what we had learned
            in a "live" project, and that's when I created this website.
            Since practicing route structuring was the main goal,
            I kept that in mind during the creation, and as I appreciate a design touch,
            I added a bit of CSS3 as well.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: '1em' }}>What can we find on it?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Navbar</li>
            <li>Responsiveness</li>
            <li>My first hamburger menu</li>
            <li>Four main pages and their subpages</li>
            <li>Harmony in design</li>
        </ul>
    </>
